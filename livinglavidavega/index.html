                    <p>Josh and Vanessa met and became good friends through a mutual friend, Luke, Josh’s best man. One day at a friend’s party, mid conversation, without permission, Josh leaned in and kissed Vanessa...but Vanessa didn’t kiss back! The next words out of her mouth would ring in Josh’s head for days and days, “Ummm, what are you doing?”, she said. Josh abruptly turned around, walked away, and immediately found Luke. Josh asked, “I thought you said Vanessa liked me?!” Luke's mischievous laughter and joy in Josh's confusion made it apparent that Luke had played a prank on him.</p>
                    <p>Three days later, Josh finally decided to respond to Vanessa’s constant messages. She wasn’t angry with him, but only liked him as a friend, nothing else. They eventually talked about what happened and something strange happened as Josh and Vanessa stayed friends even while Josh was in Tallahassee studying at FSU... like something straight out of a movie, Vanessa started to fall for Josh! Quite embarrassed, but fueled by her girlfriends' encouragement and love of potential heart-break dramas, Vanessa met up with Josh one weekend at homecoming in Gainesville in the hopes that Josh felt the same about her, and well, I think you know how that ended.</p>

                    <li><span>About:</span>
                        <p>Valeria is 18 years old and lives with our dad and her mom, my stepmom Ivette, in Plantation, FL. She is in her senior year of high school and in June, Valeria is graduating and plans to move to Tallahassee to attend FSU and pursue a career in Musical Theater where she can live out her dream of dance, acting, and singing.</p>

                    <li><span>Bride's Favorite Memory of Valeria:</span>
                        <p>My favorite moment with my little sister is probably every moment I get to spend with her! You see, Valeria is like the perfect sister where you can do anything or absolutely nothing with and still enjoy life with them. It is absolutely liberating when I am with her; she makes me feel like I can be myself without holding back. That’s what makes her perfect. It’s my absolute favorite to watch her grow up to be the amazing person she is and makes me feel so special when she seeks my advice. I love her to death and I’m very proud of all she’s done.</p>

                    <li><span>Relation:</span> Friend</li>
                    <li><span>How They Met:</span> I met Carrie when she moved down with her husband Trent from Georgia to work as a nurse in the same ICU at the University of Miami Hospital.</li>
                    <li><span>Bride's Favorite Memory of Carrie:</span>
                        <p>Carrie and her husband Trent currently work at New Hanover Regional Medical Center; Carrie as an ICU nurse and Trent as a Nurse Anesthetist.</p>
                        <p>My favorite moment of Carrie is also one of my saddest. Carrie was moving away and it was our last day together at work. I was handling it very well until she decided to have a last “work hug”. Hugging her brought down a waterfall of memories of the couple years I had known her.</p>
                        <p>Who would be there to tell me not to curse so much, to stop being a bossy control freak, and to never to use the lords name in vain? She encouraged me to try new things like paddle boarding, trying/loving champagne, and always pushed me to be more involved at work, which led to me being charge nurse and wound care leader on my unit. More than that, she taught me to appreciate Josh even more by reminding me how amazing we were when we were together and how in love you could tell we are. She is just the person that makes you realize how good your life was before they came in, and how absolutely amazing it is now that they are here.</p>

                        <p>Lia is a nurse at Miami Children’s hospital and works in their Neonatal ICU. She is currently pursuing a Masters degree at the University of Miami to become a Family Nurse Practitioner. She adores her big family and loves spending time with amazing boyfriend named Shannon.</p>
                        <p>My favorite moment with Lia was actually the first time I ever met her. I was in my Biology class when it was time for another quiz and I was not prepared at all. Luckily a girl named Lia had decided to sit next to me that day. I thought she looked like she knew what she was doing and decided to peak off her quiz here and there.</p>
                        <p>Lo and behold, I was thrilled to have passed with a C. We chatted after class and have been friends ever since. Like I’ve told her previously, I don't know how I lived my life without her before we met, but I know I can’t live a moment without my Twin in my life now. And it turns out, she knew I was peaking at her quiz the entire time and still let me do it, which proves what a sweetheart she really is!</p>

                        <p>I met Vanessa Hernandez (Vanesita) during my freshman year at the University of Miami where she obtained a Bachelors degree in Psychology. She also recently earned a Bachelors in Nursing from Nova Southeastern University.</p>
                        <p>Vane was my partner in crime for all adventures and shenanigans throughout my college years when everyday was a good beach day, there was always room for one more drink, and there was no such thing as being too tired to go out dancing. She’s extremely smart and a definite go-getter that lights up a room with her personality. We’ve had so many hysterical times together you’ll often catch us reliving quotes and conversations from those moments constantly!</p>

                        <p>Daphne and I started to really get close a few years ago and I’ve enjoyed every moment of having her in my life, especially now, as my family. My favorite memory with Daphne is probably when the time had come to pick my bridesmaids for the wedding. Besides my own sister, Valeria, Daphne’s name was first to pop into my head. Daphne has been warm and inviting and very sweet to me from the start so to me the choice was obvious! She is such a beautiful person inside and out and I consider it an absolute privilege to soon become sisters. She’s funny, energetic, and incredibly optimistic with all things; her personality is contagious!</p>

                        <p>When I think of my favorite moments with Luke I think of every moment we went out for a drive in his famous red Ford Explorer in high school. We used to pack the car with friends, buy the cheapest alcohol we could and drink in his car in a parking lot or on the beach before going out. Hanging out in the explorer was easily the most fun we would have on any given night. On those extra good nights we would get into a little mischief on the way home; Luke is very good at this.</p>

                        <p>I’ll always remember Joseph in our senior year pep-rally at Gables high school. Not only do I remember him dancing all over the stage as a part of the “Backstreet Boas” in the senior class skit, he was also the icing on the cake at the end of the pep-rally. Since the pep-rally happened near Halloween, everyone jumped on stage with their costumes and out comes Joseph in a full-blown astronaut costume, enormous helmet and all. All I remember is that astronaut had some moves.</p>
                        <p>Joseph is a firefighter/paramedic for the City of Miami and loves to spend time on the beach with his wife Monica. Monica studied political science/pre-law and currently works at an attorney’s office as a paralegal. </p>

                    <li><span>Relation:</span> Friend</li>
                    <li><span>How They Met:</span> I met BFell in college at Florida State University. He and Luke are in the same fraternity, Delta Tau Delta.</li>
                    <li><span>Groom's Favorite Memory of Brian:</span>
                        <p>BFell and I lived together for two years at FSU, our senior year in a townhouse right next door to Gal and a group of friends. Unlike the never-ending nights out in Miami, bars in college towns like Tallahassee close at 2am. We would often come back home after a night out and hang out in one of the townhouses.</p>
                        <p>When Brian was in a good mood we would blast music, throw him a baseball bat and watch him go to work on his “bat-guitar.” Nothing would get him shredding more than “Bleed it Out” by Linkin Park. Rockstar college nights behind him, Brian is a recently married man, to his amazing new wife Jenny! Now Brian enjoys wine, fine dining and even runs marathons with Jenny, though he will never give up his one true passion of rooting for the FSU Seminoles.</p>

                    <li><span>How They Met:</span> I met Gal in college at Florida State University. We lived in the same apartment complex during our sophomore year when he lived with Brian Fell.</li>
                    <li><span>Groom's Favorite Memory of Gal:</span>
                        <p>Gal and I are REALLY into FSU sports. We were always at football or basketball games when we were in college and know way too much about our school’s sports teams. While we haven’t gone to many games since we’ve graduated, we are always staying on top of the latest news, analyzing live games and even providing color commentary when one of us can’t watch a game.</p>
                        <p>Also, if you’re looking for a dance partner, Gal’s your guy! He was always fascinating the ladies with his Chris Brown and Usher-like moves on the dance floor and enjoys bonding over episodes of So You Think You Can Dance with Vanessa.</p>

                    <li><span>Groom's Favorite Memory of Jodo:</span>
                        <p>When I think of Jodo I always remember our times on the basketball court. We have been playing basketball since our high-school years when we would go to the Youth Center every day after school and play for hours on end. These days, we are limited to nights and weekends with busy schedules. We are both huge sports fans and are always talking about the latest sports headlines, watching games and rambling about college football rankings.</p>
                        <p>Jodo and Indira (Indie) have been together for years and compliment each other perfectly as she is just as clever and driven as he is. Together they cheer one another on to finish school: Jodo’s PhD in Finance and Indie’s Doctorate in Physical Therapy.</p>
